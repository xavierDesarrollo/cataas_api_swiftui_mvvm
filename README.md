Init project:

User Interface: This app is in swiftui with mvvm and observable pattern, you can see de view models and views working together, the model is exactly than response mock, the first screen is already done.

Tests: I am testing BreedViewModel data only, if you have problems with parsing and other null exception tests will not work.

The architecture is the most important of this app.

Enjoy it.
